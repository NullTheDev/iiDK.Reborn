# iiDK.Reborn

Thank you for 2 amazing years! I’m taking over development to **maintain and patch the DLL** <3  
The GitHub repo itself won’t be updated—only the **compiled DLL releases** will get fixes and improvements.  

## About

**iiDK.Reborn** is the maintenance fork of iiDK’s original mod menu for Gorilla Tag.  
I’m not rewriting it and **won’t be updating the GitHub code**, just keeping the **DLL releases patched, stable, and playable**.  

### Why Open Source?

Open source keeps Gorilla Tag modding **free, collaborative, and educational**. Everyone can learn, experiment, and contribute, without paywalls or hidden code.  

### Using the Code

GPL-3.0 applies. If you use it:
- Keep your project open-source  
- Credit the original authors  
- Don’t lock or hide code  
- Follow the [GPL license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)
